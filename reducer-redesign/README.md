## Shift reducer redesign

"Design" is pushing it, I know.

Find it [here](https://bakkot.github.io/misc/reducer-redesign/).

Parts:
- [Shift-reducer](https://github.com/shapesecurity/shift-reducer-js)
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
- [Realms shim](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms/tree/master/shim)
- [lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string)


TODO:
- this should have the (checked) AST constructors in scope
- this should have the spec in scope
